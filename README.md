### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Fall 2022

+ Project title: Minds bending Space and Time
+ This project is conducted by Sameer Kolluri

+ Project summary: The study of philosophy has given us many schools of thought by which we can choose to govern our lives. The greatest thinkers throughout time have attempted to provide society a logically consistent framework in which to lead a life. As one surveys the course the history of humanity has taken, it is only natural for the study of the "love for wisdom" to have been birthed. In many cases, the thought process and reasoning for a school of though were later expanded upon by other thinkers who believed in the same rationale, but were separated by time and/or space. It can be observed that contributions to certain schools, such as feminism and analytic philosophy, happen over longer decades if not centuries, so it is interesting to think how the beliefs were maintained or even updated over time. What does it take for such connections to occur? Are these unique situations or is there an ability to explain these parallels? In this analysis, I dive deeper into the data.
